\textbf{Tensor networks.}
Tensor networks are widely used in quantum physics~\citep{orus2014practical}, 
numerical analysis~\citep{grasedyck2013literature}, and machine learning~\citep{cichocki2016tensor,cichocki2017tensor}. 
In neural networks, \citet{cohen2016convolutional} and \citet{khrulkov2018expressive} 
use tensor networks to prove the expressive power of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Recently, \citet{hayashi2019exploring} combine tensor networks with genetic algorithms to search for efficient layer designs.
However, traditional tensor networks do not support {\em convolutions} in their operations, which is essential in convolutional neural networks.
