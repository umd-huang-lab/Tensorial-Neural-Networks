\caption{\textbf{TNN performance under various model scales for diverse machine learning tasks.} Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) on LibriSpeech is measured by Word Error Rate (WER) (the lower, the better). Image classification (IC) on CIFAR10 (results from~\cite{su2018tensorial}) is measured by top-1 precision. Video classification (VC) on UCF-101 is measured by top-1 accuracy.}
