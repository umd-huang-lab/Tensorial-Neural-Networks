\begin{abstract}
Modern neural networks achieve state-of-the-art results over a vast array of machine learning problems, but at the cost of increasing parameters, in some cases numbering in the billions. Such large models are slow and unsuitable for machine learning on constrained edge clients such as IoT and mobile devices. One strategy for compactifying a network without sacrificing much expressive power is to reshape it into a tensorial neural network (TNN), which is a higher-order tensorization of its layers, followed by a factorization, such as a CP-decomposition, which strips down a weight to its critical structural components. In this paper, we introduce an open-source library \autotnn, which can build and train a TNN based upon a user-specified backbone network and tensor factorization scheme. Our library extends the well-known \einsum method to handle convolutions, thereby allowing any forward or backward pass to be regarded as a tensor graph, and leverages our generalized version of \citet{pfeifer2014faster}'s \netcon algorithm to evaluate the graph in a FLOPs-optimal order. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of model scales over diverse tasks, including image classification, speech recognition, and video classification, demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of \autotnn model training.
